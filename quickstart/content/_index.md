# About Me

Hi, my name is Nikhil. A few quick facts:
- I'm currently a firmware engineer at [Bevi](https://bevi.co/) in Boston, MA.
- I'm fairly active on [Github](https://github.com/nikhil-nayyar) and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44357889-nikhil).
- In my freetime, I like to read, write (mostly satire now), and play tennis.
